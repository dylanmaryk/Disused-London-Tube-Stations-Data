Disused-London-Tube-Stations-Data
=================================

This JSON data (used for https://dylanmaryk.github.io/disused-stations-map) was rather crudely scraped from Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_former_and_unopened_London_Underground_stations#Former_stations). It provides data on the 77 closed, transferred or demolished Underground stations within and around London. Most of the data was scraped using PHP (https://classic.scraperwiki.com/scrapers/disused_underground_stations), although some data had to be added manually and hence is not in the scraper's datastore, as detailed in the code comment at the bottom of the scraper.
